    /*
     * 1. Do some personal hw on the physics aspects of unity, as environment has rules that are unknown to us right now
     * 
     * 2. Enviornment might have certain components missing, such as rigidbodies and collider boxes
     *      Add what is needed
     * 
     * 3. Ontriggerexit is running when component hits collider and leaves for some reason
     * 
     * 4. Naming conventions needs to be carried out thru breadboard and then prefabbed
     * 
     * 5. Figure out snap in place
