# ProjectWorldTree

This is a GitHub organization that I created to help streamline communications within our team. 

Our rapid development required us to create multiple branches to explore different features, and merge them when necessary. 

Towards the end of my time at the company, we culminated all of our important work into the ChristianVR branch, to be used as a demo location.
Our guidelines were to document everything, write concise summaries and clear descriptions, and name any co-authors to our code.
