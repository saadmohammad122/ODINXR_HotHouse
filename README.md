# ProjectWorldTree
A github for common files needed for the research team to stay informed and updated.


There are a few resources to understand the github better. If you are not part of the software team,
please do not pull or push any files. Pulling the latest files for testing is done with permission from Tessa and
Professor Poshtun. If you don't know, feel free to ask! :)

Remember, document everything. Write concise summaries, clear descriptions, and name any co-authors to your code; your work should be traceable.
